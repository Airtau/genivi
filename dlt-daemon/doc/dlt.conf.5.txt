DLT.CONF(5)
=============
:doctype: manpage

NAME
----
dlt.conf - DLT daemon configuration file

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The DLT daemon is the central place where logs and traces are gathered
from different applications, stored temporarily or permanently and
transferred to a DLT client application, which can run directly on the
GENIVI system or more likely on a external tester device.

The configuration file dlt.conf allows to configure the different
runtime behaviour of the dlt-daemon. The configuration file is loaded
during startup of dlt-daemon.

dlt-daemon loads by default the configuration file /etc/dlt.conf. An
alternative configuration file can be loaded with the option -c.

GENERAL OPTIONS
---------------

*Daemonize*::
    If set to 1 DLT daemon is started in background as daemon. This option
    is only needed in System V init systems. In systemd based startup
    systems the daemon is started by spawning own process.

    Default: 0

*SendSerialHeader*::
    If set to 1 DLT daemon sends each DLT message to the client with
    prepanding the serial header "DLS0x01".

    Default: 0

*SendContextRegistration*::
    If set to 1 each context which is registered from an application in the
    DLT daemon generates a message to inform the DLT client about the new
    context.

    Default: 0

*SendMessageTime*::
    If set to 1 DLt daemon sends each second a DLT control message to the
    client with the current timestamp from the system.

    Default: 0

*ECUId*::
    This value sets the ECU Id, which is sent with each DLT message.

    Default: ECU1

*SharedMemorySize*::
    This value sets the size of the shared memory, which is used to exchange
    DLT messages between applications and daemon. This value is defined in
    bytes. If this value is changed the system must be rebooted to take
    effect.

    Default: 100000

*PersistanceStoragePath*::
    This is the directory path, where the DLT daemon stores its runtime
    configuration. Runtime configuration includes stored log levels, trace
    status and changed logging mode. 

    Default: /tmp

OFFLINE TRACE OPTIONS
---------------------

*OfflineTraceDirectory*::
    If this option is set, offline trace is enabled. This value sets the
    directory path to the offline trace memory. The directory must already
    exist.

    Default: Offline tracing is disabled.

*OfflineTraceFileSize*::
    This value defines the max size of a offline trace file, if offline trace
    is enabled. This value is defined in bytes. If the files size of the
    current used log file is exceeded, a new log file is created. 

    Default: 1000000

*OfflineTraceMaxSize*::
    This value defines the max offline Trace memory size, if offline trace
    is enabled. This value is defined in bytes. If the overall offline trace
    size is excedded, the oldest log files are deleted, until a new trace
    file fits the overall offline trace max size.

    Default: 4000000

LOCAL CONSOLE OUTPUT OPTIONS
----------------------------

*PrintASCII*::
    Prints each received DLT message from the application in ASCII to the
    local console.
    This option should only be anabled for debugging purpose.

    Default: Function is disabled

*PrintHex*::
    Prints each received DLT message from the application in ASCII to the
    local console. The payload is printed in Hex.
    This option should only be anabled for debugging purpose.

    Default: Function is disabled

*PrintHeadersOnly*::
    Prints each received DLT message from the application in ASCII to the
    local console. Only the header is printed.
    This option should only be anabled for debugging purpose.

    Default: Function is disabled

SERIAL CLIENT OPTIONS
---------------------

*RS232DeviceName*::
    If this value is set to a serial device name, e.g. /dev/ttyS0, a serial
    port is used for logging to a client. 

    Default: Serial port for logging is disabled

*RS232Baudrate*::
    The used serial baud rate, if serial loggin is enabled. The
    RS232DeviceName must be set to enable serial logging.

    Default: 115200

*RS232SyncSerialHeader*::
    If serial logging is enabled, each received DLT message is checked to
    contain a serial header. If the DLT message contains no serial header,
    the message is ignored.

    Default: Function is disabled

TCP CLIENT OPTIONS
------------------

*TCPSyncSerialHeader*::
    Each received DLT message on a TCP connection is checked to contain a
    serial header. If the DLT message contains no serial header, the message
    is ignored.

ECU Software version info
-------------------------

*SendECUSoftwareVersion*::
    Send periodic ECU version info. 0=disabled, 1=enabled.

    Default: 0

*PathToECUSoftwareVersion*::
    Absolute path to file storing version information - if disabled the DLT version will be send.

EXAMPLES
--------
Start DLT daemon in background mode::
    *dlt-daemon -d*

Start DLT daemon with own configuration::
    *dlt-daemon -c ~/my-dlt-configuration.cfg*
