NAME

dlt-system.conf - DLT system process configuration file

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The DLT system logging process is the central application, which logs
system information from the platform. It provides the features
filetransfer, syslog adapater, logging of any kind of files and
procfilesystem logger. The individual features can be enabled and
disabled in the configuration file. 

The configuration file dlt-system.conf allows to configure the different
runtime behaviour of dlt-system. The configuration file is loaded
during startup of dlt-system.

dlt-system loads by default the configuration file /etc/dlt-system.conf.
An alternative configuration file can be loaded with the option -c.

    In mode 2 the file is logged regularly every time LogFileTimeDelay timer
    elapses.

*LogFileTimeDelay*::
    This value is used in mode 3 and defines the number of seconds, after
    which the defined file is logged.
