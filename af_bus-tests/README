Test suite for AF_BUS sockets

Introduction
============

The test suite is composed of unit tests that check that all the
possible BSD sockets primitives are working for AF_BUS sockets
(socket, bind, getsockname, connect, listen, poll), unicast and
multicast send and receive and AF_BUS specific operations such
as adding and removing AF_BUS addresses to a socket, adding
match rules, passing file descriptors, increasing sending buffer
size and eavesdropping.

Configuration
=============

af_bus-tests can be build using autotools.

the tests can be executed with the following command:

$ make check
